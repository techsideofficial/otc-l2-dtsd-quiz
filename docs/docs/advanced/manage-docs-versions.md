The quiz configuration can be found in the same folder as the executable. It is called `QuizConfig_Questions.json`

The file uses the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "Options": [
      "Answer 1",
      "Answer 2",
      "Answer 3",
      "Answer 4"
    ],
    "Question": "This is a question?",
    "Answer": "Answer 1"
  }
]
```
